                    The foundation of this church is the Lord Jesus Christ
                    <i>(1 Corinthians 3:11; Ephesians 2:20)</i>, and He guides
                    His church in all affairs through the Holy Scriptures
                    <i>(Psalms 119; 2 Timothy 3:15-17)</i>. Therefore, the
                    purpose of this church is to be Bible-centered,
                    Disciple-making and to glorify God through Jesus Christ, in

                    The priorities of the ministry of this church flow from the

                    to savor this vision in worship <i>(John 4:23)</i>,
                    strengthen the vision in nurture
                    <i>(1 Corinthians 14:26; 2 Peter 3:18)</i>, and spread the
                    vision in discipleship, evangelism, missions, and loving
                    deeds
                    <i>(Matthew 5:16; 28:18-20; 1 Peter 2:9; 3:15)</i>.

                    <i>(Acts 20:27; 2 Timothy 4:1-2)</i>, administering baptism
                    <i>(Matthew 28:19; Romans 6:1-4)</i> and the Lord’s Supper
                    <i>(Luke 22:19; 1 Corinthians 11:17-34)</i>, loving one

                    <i>(John 13:34-35; 1 John 3:11-24; 4:7-12)</i>, making

                an infinite intelligent Spirit, whose name is JEHOVAH, the Maker
                and supreme Ruler of heaven and earth; inexpressibly glorious in
                holiness, and worthy of all possible honor, confidence and love;
                that in the unity of the Godhead there are three persons, the
                Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit; equal in every divine
                perfection and executing distinct but harmonious offices in the
                great work of redemption.

                Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He is co-equal with the Father.
                He is fully God and fully man. Jesus lived a sinless life as a
                human and offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins
                of His people by dying a substitutionary death on a cross. He
                arose from the dead after three days to demonstrate His power
                over sin and death. He ascended to Heaven’s glory and will
                return again someday to earth to reign as King of Kings and Lord
                of Lords.

                The Holy Spirit is co-equal with the Father and the Son of God.
                He makes men aware of their sin and enables them to see their
                need to be rescued from the wrath of God by Jesus Christ. He
                also lives in every Christian from the moment of salvation. He
                provides the Christian with power for living, understanding of
                spiritual truth, and guidance in doing what is right. As
                Christians, we seek to live under His control daily.

                We believe that the Holy Bible was written by men divinely
                inspired, and is a perfect treasure of heavenly instruction;
                that it has God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth
                without any mixture of error for its matter, that it reveals the
                principles by which God will judge us; and therefore is, and
                shall remain to the end of the world, the true center of
                Christian union , and the supreme standard by which all human
                conduct, creeds, and opinions should be tried.

                We believe that man was created in holiness, under the law of
                his Maker, but by voluntary transgression fell from that holy
                and happy state; in consequence of which all mankind are now
                sinners, not by constraint but choice; being by nature utterly
                void of that holiness required by the law of God, positively
                inclined to evil; and therefore under just condemnation to
                eternal ruin, without defense or excuse.

                appointment of the Father freely took upon him our nature, yet
                without sin; honored the divine law by his personal obedience,
                and by his death made a full atonement for our sins; that having
                risen from the dead, he is now enthroned in heaven; and uniting
                in his wonderful person the tenderest sympathies with divine
                perfections, he is every way qualified to be a suitable, a
