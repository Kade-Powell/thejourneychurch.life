                At Journey we believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God
                and that it is a perfect treasure of heavenly instruction. We
                believe that the Bible is necessary for the life and the growth
                of the church and that the Bible is sufficient in it’s wisdom
                for the church and instruction to the church. Therefore we want
                the Bible to be central in our individual lives and in the life
                of Journey Church.

                At Journey we believe that the Lord did not leave it to us to
                decide what the mission of the church should be. We believe that
                the Lord has made it clear that we are live our lives making
                disciples of Jesus Christ. Therefore we want to be involved in
                the lives of others for their spiritual good encouraging one
                another in our faithfulness to our Lord Jesus Christ and being
                involved in the lives of the world around us in such a way that
                we are able to share and show the love of Jesus Christ.

                At Journey we believe that the chief end of man is to glorify
                God and to enjoy Him forever. We believe that true life and
                lasting joy is the result of living for the glory of our Triune
                God. Therefore by God’s grace we seek to be a community of
                Christ followers who seek to help one another live our lives to
                the Glory of God.

                Our services generally start with a reading from the scripture.
                Then we have a time of praise and worship that is generally
                three songs. Afterwards we have a practical biblical teaching
                with that is easy to understand and apply.
